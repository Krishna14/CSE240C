# CSE 240C
Advanced Microarchitecture - Contributions related to the micro-architectural reverse engineering of modern processors.

### Instructions for homework 1

To run the code, please run ./latencyComputation.o. If you choose to compile from src, run the Makefile.

That will generate the latencyComputation.o which could later be run. 

This only supports latency computation on those processors that have a 64 byte cache line size.

Support for other cache line sizes will be extended by tomorrow.
